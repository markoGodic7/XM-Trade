The app dynamically generates cards for each filtered coin, displaying its symbol, name, price, and 24-hour
price change. The cards also include the coin's logo, which is stored locally in the img folder, and the path
to the image is specified in the modified JSON file.
To see it, run it trough VS Live Server.
